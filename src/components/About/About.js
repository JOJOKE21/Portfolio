     <p className='tex7'>Hello my name is Jordan Gant and Software Development has been a dream ever since I was a kid. The reason why I wanted to become a Software Developer was because
      I wanted to know more about how video games and how websites work. To do that I need to learn more about coding. Thanks to the Nebula Academy Software Engineer bootcamp I have
      learned more about Software Development with the help of great teachers and also great students. After the bootcamp I would like to further my education in this field of coding and get a job
      that I find comfortable. Furthermore I would also like to help in game development for smaller, less popular companies/indie game developers as it has always been my dream to make a video game.
